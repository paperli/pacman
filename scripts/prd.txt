# Overview  
A modern remake of the classic PAC-MAN game, reimagined as a first-person 3D web game. Players navigate the iconic PAC-MAN maze from a first-person perspective, collecting pellets to earn points, avoiding ghosts, and utilizing power-ups. The game combines the nostalgia of PAC-MAN with the immersive mechanics of modern first-person shooters (FPS), including keyboard and mouse controls, sprinting, and energy management. The goal is to deliver a fresh, engaging experience that honors the original while introducing new gameplay depth.

# Core Features  
- **First-Person Perspective:**
  - Players experience the PAC-MAN maze through the eyes of PAC-MAN, increasing immersion and challenge.
  - Classic maze layout faithfully recreated in 3D.
- **Pellet Collection:**
  - Players collect pellets scattered throughout the maze to earn points.
  - Eating all pellets completes the level.
- **Ghost AI:**
  - Four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde) patrol the maze with unique behaviors inspired by the original game.
  - Ghosts actively hunt the player using pathfinding and line-of-sight mechanics.
- **Power-Ups:**
  - Randomly spawned power-ups allow the player to temporarily calm or repel ghosts.
  - Classic power-pellets enable the player to "eat" ghosts for bonus points.
- **Sprint Mechanic:**
  - Holding Shift allows the player to move faster (turbo mode), consuming a limited energy bar.
  - Energy recharges after a cooldown when depleted.
- **Modern FPS Controls:**
  - WASD for movement, mouse to look/turn, Shift to sprint, Space to jump (if applicable).
  - Optional: Add crouch or slide for advanced movement.
- **HUD & Feedback:**
  - On-screen display for score, remaining energy, power-up timers, and ghost proximity alerts.
- **Audio & Visuals:**
  - Classic PAC-MAN sounds remixed for 3D/FPS context.
  - Visual effects for power-ups, sprinting, and ghost encounters.
- **Game Over & High Scores:**
  - Game ends when caught by a ghost or all pellets are collected.
  - High score tracking and leaderboard.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Colorblind-friendly ghost indicators.
  - Adjustable mouse sensitivity and key remapping.

# User Experience  
- **User Personas:**
  - Retro gamers seeking nostalgia with a twist.
  - FPS enthusiasts looking for a unique arcade experience.
  - Casual players attracted by simple controls and quick sessions.
- **Key User Flows:**
  - Start game → Select level → Enter maze → Collect pellets → Avoid/repel ghosts → Use power-ups → Complete level or get caught → View score/leaderboard.
- **UI/UX Considerations:**
  - Minimalist HUD to avoid clutter.
  - Clear audio/visual cues for danger, power-ups, and objectives.
  - Smooth, responsive controls with low input latency.

# Technical Architecture  
- **System Components:**
  - WebGL/Three.js (or Babylon.js) for 3D rendering.
  - Game engine logic (custom or lightweight framework).
  - State management for player, ghosts, pellets, and power-ups.
  - Audio engine for effects and music.
- **Data Models:**
  - Player (position, energy, score, status)
  - Ghosts (type, position, state, AI behavior)
  - Pellets (location, collected status)
  - Power-ups (type, location, active status)
  - Level (maze layout, spawn points)
- **APIs & Integrations:**
  - Local storage or backend for high scores/leaderboards.
  - Optional: Analytics for player behavior.
- **Infrastructure Requirements:**
  - Runs in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
  - Responsive design for various screen sizes.

# Development Roadmap  
- **MVP Requirements:**
  - 3D maze rendering and navigation
  - Basic pellet collection and scoring
  - Ghost AI with basic pursuit/avoidance
  - Power-up spawning and effects
  - Sprint/energy mechanic
  - HUD with score and energy display
  - Game over and restart flow
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Multiple maze layouts/levels
  - Advanced ghost AI (learning, adaptive behaviors)
  - Multiplayer mode (co-op or versus)
  - Cosmetic unlocks (skins, effects)
  - Mobile/touch controls
  - Accessibility improvements

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Implement 3D maze and player movement (foundation)
- Add pellet collection and scoring
- Integrate ghost AI and collision detection
- Add power-ups and effects
- Implement sprint/energy system
- Build HUD and feedback systems
- Add game over, restart, and high score tracking
- Polish audio/visuals and accessibility
- Expand with additional features (levels, multiplayer, etc.)

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Technical Challenges:**
  - 3D pathfinding for ghosts: Use existing algorithms (A*) and optimize for maze layout.
  - Performance in browser: Optimize assets and rendering, use efficient data structures.
- **MVP Scope:**
  - Focus on core loop (maze, pellets, ghosts, power-ups, sprint) before enhancements.
- **Resource Constraints:**
  - Modular codebase to allow incremental development and easy onboarding.
